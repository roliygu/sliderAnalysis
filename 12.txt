1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,839
You now know about linear regression
and gradient descent. The plan from here

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,437
on out is to tell you about a couple of
important extensions of these ideas.

3
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:13,668
Concretely here they are. First it turns
out that in order to solve this

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:18,468
minimization problem, turns out there's an
algorithm for solving for theta zero and

5
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:22,978
theta one exactly without needing an
iterative algorithm. Without needing this

6
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:27,555
algorithm like gradient descent that we
had to iterate, you know, multiple times

7
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:32,285
over. So it turns out there are advantages
and disadvantages of this algorithm that

8
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:36,897
lets you just solve for theta zero and
theta one, basically in just one shot. One

9
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:41,685
advantage is that there is no longer a
learning rate alpha that you need to worry

10
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:46,414
about and set. And so it can be much
faster for some problems. We'll talk about

11
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:51,051
its advantages and disadvantages later.
Second, we'll also talk about algorithms

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,424
for learning with a larger number of
features. So, so far we've been learning

13
00:00:55,424 --> 00:01:00,027
with just one feature, the size of the
house and using that to predict the price,

14
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:04,688
so we're trying to take x and use that to
predict y. But for other learning problems

15
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:09,899
we may have a larger number of features.
So for example let's say that you know not

16
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,448
only the size, but also the number of
bedrooms, the number of floors, and the age

17
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:20,930
of these houses. And you want
to use that to predict the price of the

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,005
houses. In that case maybe we'll call
these features x1, x2, x3, and x4. So now

19
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:31,554
we have, you know, four features. We want to
use these four features to predict why the

20
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:36,797
price of the house. It turns out with all
of these features, four of them in this

21
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:41,858
case, it turns out that with multiple
features it becomes harder to

22
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:47,243
plot or visualize the data. So for example
here we try to plot this type of data

23
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:52,823
set. Maybe we will have the vertical axis
be the price and maybe we can have one

24
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:58,078
axis here, and another one here where this
axis is the size of the house, and that

25
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,822
axis is the number of bedrooms. You know,
but this is just plotting, right my first

26
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:07,414
two features: size and number of bedrooms.
And when we have these additional features

27
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:11,677
I don't know, I just don't know how to
plot all of these data, right cuz I need

28
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:15,886
like a 4-dimensional or 5-dimensional
figure. I don't really know how to plot

29
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,930
you know something more than like a
3-dimensional figure, like, like what I

30
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,139
have over here. Also as you can tell, the
notation starts to get a little more

31
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,238
complicated, right. So rather than just
having x our features we now have x1

32
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:33,519
through x4. And we're using these
subscripts to denote my four different

33
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,059
features. It turns out the best notation
to keep all of this straight and to

34
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:42,828
understand what's going on with the data
even when we don't quite know how to plot

35
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:47,425
it. It turns out that the best notation is
the notation of linear algebra. Linear

36
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:52,194
algebra gives us a notation and a set of
things or a set of operations that we can

37
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:58,234
do with matrices and vectors. For example.
Here's a matrix where the columns of this

38
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:03,377
matrix are: The first column is the sizes
of the four houses, the second column was

39
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:08,025
the number of bedrooms, that's the number
of floors and that was the age of the

40
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:12,496
home. And so a matrix is a block of
numbers that lets me take all of my data,

41
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:17,881
all of my x's. All of my features and
organize them efficiently into sort of one

42
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:23,565
big block of numbers like that. And here
is what we call a vector in linear algebra

43
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:29,118
where the four numbers here are the prices
of the four houses that we saw on the

44
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:34,334
previous slide. So. In the next set of
videos what I'm going to do is do a quick

45
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:38,730
review of linear algebra. If you haven't
seen matrices and vectors before, so if

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,293
all of this, everything on this slide is
brand new to you or if you've seen linear

47
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:47,745
algebra before, but it's been a while so
you aren't completely familiar with it

48
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:52,419
anymore, then please watch the next set of
videos. And I'll quickly review the linear

49
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,093
algebra you need in order to implement and
use the more powerful versions of linear

50
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:01,489
regression. It turns out linear algebra
isn't just useful for linear regression

51
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,972
models but these ideas of matrices and
vectors will be useful for helping us

52
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:10,272
to implement and actually get
computationally efficient implementations

53
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:15,088
for many later machines learning models as
well. And as you can tell these sorts of

54
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,617
matrices and vectors will give us an
efficient way to start to organize large

55
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:23,918
amounts of data, when we work with larger
training sets. So, in case, in case

56
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,619
you're not familiar with linear algebra or
in case linear algebra seems like a

57
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:33,263
complicated, scary concept for those of you who've
never seen it before, don't worry about

58
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:37,793
it. It turns out in order to implement
machine learning algorithms we need only

59
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:42,002
the very, very basics of
linear algebra and you'll be able to very

60
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:46,840
quickly pick up everything you need to
know in the next few videos.

61
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,386
Concretely, to decide if you should
watch the next set of videos, here are the

62
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:57,804
topics I'm going to cover. Talk about
what are matrices and vectors. Talk about how

63
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:02,222
to add, subtract, multiply matrices and vectors.
Talk about the ideas of matrix inverses

64
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:06,696
and transposes. And so, if you are not
sure if you should watch the next set of

65
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:11,393
videos take a look at these two things. So
if you think you know how to compute this

66
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:15,643
quantity, this matrix transpose times
another matrix. If you think you know, if

67
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:20,173
you have seen this stuff before, if you
know how to compute the inverse of matrix

68
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:24,423
times a vector, minus a number, times
another vector. If these two things look

69
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:29,309
completely familiar to you then you can
safely skip the optional set of videos on

70
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:34,607
linear algebra. But if these, concepts, if you're
slightly uncertain what these blocks of

71
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:39,906
numbers or these matrices of numbers mean,
then please take a look of the next set of

72
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:45,142
videos and, it'll very quickly teach you what
you need to know about linear algebra in

73
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:49,936
order to program machine learning
algorithms and deal with large amounts of data.
