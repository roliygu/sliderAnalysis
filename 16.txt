1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,558
In this video we talk about

2
00:00:01,558 --> 00:00:03,577
matrix, matrix multiplication or

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,262
how to multiply two matrices together.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,935
When we talk about the method

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,412
in linear regression for how

6
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:11,251
to solve for the parameters,

7
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,195
theta zero and theta one, all in one shot.

8
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:16,601
So, without needing an iterative algorithm like gradient descent.

9
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,005
When we talk about that algorithm,

10
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,982
it turns out that matrix, matrix

11
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:23,086
multiplication is one of the key steps that you need to know.

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,885
So, let's, as usual, start with an example.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,558
Let's say I have two matrices

14
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,060
and I want to multiply them together.

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,343
Let me again just reference this

16
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,441
example and then I'll tell you in a little bit what happens.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,154
So, the first thing

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,589
I'm gonna do is, I'm going

19
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:43,154
to pull out the first

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,545
column of this matrix on the right.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,135
And I'm going to take this

22
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,163
matrix on the left and

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,385
multiply it by, you know, a vector.

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,188
That's just this first column, OK?

25
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,385
And it turns out if I

26
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:59,067
do that I am going to get the vector 11, 9.

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,068
So, this is the same matrix

28
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,932
vector multiplication as you saw in the last videos.

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,934
I worked this out in advance so, I know it's 11, 9.

30
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,519
And, then, the second thing

31
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,811
I'm going to do is, I'm going

32
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,752
to pull out the second column,

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,537
this matrix on the right and

34
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,575
I am then going to

35
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,174
take this matrix on the left,

36
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,398
right, so, it will be that matrix,

37
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,476
and multiply it by

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,902
that second column on the right.

39
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,360
So, again, this is a matrix

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,960
vector multiplication set, which

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,643
you saw from the previous video, and

42
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:31,623
it turns out that if you

43
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:32,768
multiply this matrix and this

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,250
vector, you get 10,

45
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,214
14 and by

46
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:37,472
the way, if you want to practice

47
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,776
your matrix vector multiplication, feel

48
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,810
free to pause the video and check this product yourself.

49
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,248
Then, I'm just going

50
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:45,743
to take these two results and

51
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,398
put them together, and that will be my answer.

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,962
So, turns out the

53
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,350
outcome of this product is going

54
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,449
to be a 2 by 2 matrix, and

55
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:54,467
The way I am going to fill

56
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,294
in this matrix is just by

57
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,914
taking my elements 11,

58
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,137
9 and plugging them here, and

59
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,753
taking 10, 14 and plugging

60
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,386
them into the second column.

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Okay?

62
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,824
So, that was the mechanics of

63
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,086
how to multiply a matrix by

64
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,248
another matrix.

65
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,094
You basically look at the

66
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,045
second matrix one column at a time, and you assemble the answers.

67
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,199
And again, we will step

68
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,455
through this much more carefully in

69
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,754
a second, but I just

70
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,852
want to point out also, this

71
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:26,301
first example is a 2x3 matrix matrix.

72
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,548
Multiplying that by a

73
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,649
3x2 matrix, and the

74
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,497
outcome of this product, it

75
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:35,518
turns out to be a 2x2

76
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,802
matrix.

77
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:39,121
And again, we'll see in a second why this was the case.

78
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:40,484
All right.

79
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,637
That was the mechanics of the calculation.

80
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:43,745
Let's actually look at the

81
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,953
details and look at what

82
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,305
exactly happened.

83
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,082
Here are details.

84
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,471
I have a matrix A and

85
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,325
I want to multiply that

86
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,088
with a matrix B, and the result

87
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:56,143
will be some new matrix C. And

88
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,168
it turns out you can only

89
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,238
multiply together matrices whose

90
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:00,714
dimensions match so A

91
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,239
is an m by n matrix,

92
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,468
so m columns, n columns and

93
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,394
I am going to multiply

94
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,480
that with an n by o

95
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,232
and it turns out this n

96
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,306
here must match this n

97
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,978
here, so the number of columns

98
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:16,778
in first matrix must equal to the number of rows in second matrix.

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,035
And the result of this

100
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,639
product will be an M

101
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,204
by O matrix, like the the matrix C here.

102
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,822
And, in the previous

103
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,743
video, everything we did corresponded

104
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,380
to this special case of OB

105
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,588
equal to 1.

106
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,150
Okay?

107
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,469
That was, that was in case of B being a vector.

108
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,522
But now, we are going to

109
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,805
view of the case of values of O larger than 1.

110
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,533
So, here's how you

111
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,564
multiply together the two matrices.

112
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:46,349
In order to get, what

113
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,775
I am going to do is

114
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,180
I am going to take the

115
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,025
first column of B

116
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,782
and treat that as a vector,

117
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,098
and multiply the matrix A,

118
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,909
with the first column of B,

119
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,632
and the result of that will

120
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,370
be a M by 1 vector,

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,726
and we're going to put that over here.

122
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,481
Then, I'm going to

123
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,048
take the second column

124
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,920
of B, right, so,

125
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,775
this is another n by

126
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,501
one vector, so, this column

127
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:16,690
here, this is right, n

128
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,910
by one, those are n dimensional

129
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,782
vector, gonna multiply this

130
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,678
matrix with this n by one vector.

131
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,775
The result will be

132
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,018
a M dimensional vector,

133
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,035
which we'll put there.

134
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,273
And, so on.

135
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:30,035
Okay?

136
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,135
And, so, you know, and then

137
00:04:31,135 --> 00:04:32,099
I'm going to take the third

138
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,475
column, multiply it by

139
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:37,507
this matrix, I get a M dimensional vector.

140
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,368
And so on, until you get

141
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:40,610
to the last column times,

142
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,870
the matrix times the

143
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,420
lost column gives you

144
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,757
the lost column of C.

145
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,808
Just to say that again.

146
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,510
The ith column of the

147
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,777
matrix C is attained

148
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,108
by taking the matrix A and

149
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,641
multiplying the matrix A with

150
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,638
the ith column of the

151
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,539
matrix B for the values

152
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,387
of I equals 1, 2

153
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,936
up through O. Okay ?

154
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,752
So, this is just a summary

155
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,765
of what we did up there

156
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:10,163
in order to compute the matrix

157
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,909
C.  Let's look at just one more example.

158
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,235
Let 's say, I want to multiply together these two matrices.

159
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,208
So, what I'm going to

160
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,178
do is, first pull

161
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,535
out the first column

162
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,370
of my second matrix, that

163
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,185
was matrix B, that was

164
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,133
my matrix B on the previous slide.

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
And, I therefore, have this

166
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,917
matrix times my vector and

167
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,350
so, oh, let's do this calculation quickly.

168
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,518
There's going to be equal to,

169
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:39,048
right, 1, 3 times 0,

170
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,238
3 so that gives 1

171
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,930
times 0, plus 3 times 3.

172
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,322
And, the second element

173
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,530
is going to be 2,

174
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,678
5 times 0, 3 so, that's going to

175
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:52,739
be two times 0 plus 5

176
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,276
times 3 and that is

177
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:02,242
9,15, actually didn't

178
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,672
write that in green, so this

179
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:09,365
is nine fifteen, and then mix.

180
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:12,061
I am going to pull out

181
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,451
the second column of this,

182
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,174
and do the corresponding

183
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,170
calculation so there's this

184
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,477
matrix times this vector 1, 2.

185
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:22,288
Let's also do this

186
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,814
quickly, so that's one times

187
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:27,362
one plus three times two.

188
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,973
So that deals with that

189
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,868
row, let's do the

190
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:34,223
other one, so let's see,

191
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:37,510
that gives me two times

192
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,926
one plus times two,

193
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,493
so that is going to

194
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,176
be equal to, let's see,

195
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,464
one times one plus three times

196
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:50,378
one is four and two

197
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,282
times one plus five times two

198
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,923
is twelve.

199
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,660
So now I have these two

200
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,448
you, and so my

201
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,343
outcome, so the product

202
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,714
of these two matrices is going

203
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,831
to be, this goes

204
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:07,232
here and this

205
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:09,828
goes here, so I

206
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:14,632
get nine fifteen and

207
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,831
four twelve and you

208
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,657
may notice also that the result

209
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,616
of multiplying a 2x2 matrix

210
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,687
with another 2x2 matrix.

211
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,215
The resulting dimension is going

212
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,609
to be that first two times

213
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,415
that second two, so the result

214
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,460
is itself also a two by two matrix.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,304
Finally let me show you

216
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:37,795
one more neat trick you can

217
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:40,699
do with matrix matrix multiplication.

218
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,455
Let's say as before that we

219
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:45,823
have four houses whose

220
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,970
prices we want to predict,

221
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,825
only now we have three

222
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,967
competing hypothesis shown here

223
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,145
on the right, so if

224
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:55,720
you want to So apply all

225
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,745
3 competing hypotheses to

226
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:58,951
all four of the houses, it

227
00:07:58,951 --> 00:07:59,926
turns out you can do that

228
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,718
very efficiently using a

229
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:05,080
matrix matrix multiplication so here

230
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,347
on the left is my usual

231
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,626
matrix, same as from the

232
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:11,063
last video where these values

233
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:15,012
are my housing prices and I put ones there on the left as well.

234
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:16,626
And, what I'm going to

235
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,029
do is construct another matrix, where

236
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,693
here these, the first

237
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,477
column, is this minus

238
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,062
40 and two five and

239
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,372
the second column is this two

240
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,945
hundred open one and so

241
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,278
on and it

242
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:35,925
turns out that if you

243
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,893
multiply these two matrices

244
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,448
what you find is that, this

245
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,467
first column, you know,

246
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,340
oh, well how do you get this first column, right?

247
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,850
A procedure from matrix

248
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,565
matrix multiplication is the way

249
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:51,945
you get this first column, is

250
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,360
you take this matrix and you

251
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,816
multiply it by this

252
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,724
first column, and we

253
00:08:56,724 --> 00:08:58,540
saw in the previous video that this

254
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,472
is exactly the predicted

255
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,050
housing prices of the

256
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,701
first hypothesis, right?

257
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,775
Of this first hypothesis here.

258
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,794
And, how about a second column?

259
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,955
Well, how do setup the second column?

260
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,332
The way you get the second column

261
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:15,548
is, well, you take this

262
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,270
matrix and you multiply by this second column.

263
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,293
And so this second column turns

264
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,651
out to be the predictions of

265
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,728
the second hypothesis of

266
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,228
the second hypothesis up there,

267
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:34,450
and similarly for the third column.

268
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,809
And so, I didn't step

269
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,058
through all the details but hopefully

270
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,139
you just, feel free to

271
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,448
pause the video and check

272
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,786
the math yourself and check

273
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,972
that what I just claimed really is true.

274
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,611
But it turns out that by

275
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:47,454
constructing these two matrices, what

276
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,937
you can therefore do is very

277
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,180
quickly apply all three

278
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,602
hypotheses to all four

279
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,455
house sizes to get,

280
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,452
you know, all twelve predicted

281
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,721
prices output by your

282
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,928
three hypotheses on your four houses.

283
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:03,366
So one matrix multiplications

284
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,072
that you manage to make 12

285
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,130
predictions and, even

286
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,446
better, it turns out that

287
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:09,937
in order to do that matrix

288
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,408
multiplication and there are

289
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,130
lots of good linear algebra libraries

290
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,767
in order to do this

291
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:16,676
multiplication step for you,

292
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,250
and no matter so pretty

293
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,025
much any reasonable programming language that you might be using.

294
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,005
Certainly all the top ten

295
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:27,898
most popular programming languages will have great linear algebra libraries.

296
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:29,554
And they'll be good thing are

297
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,463
highly optimized in order

298
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,415
to do that, matrix matrix

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,531
multiplication very efficiently, including

300
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:38,501
taking, taking advantage of

301
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,119
any parallel computation that

302
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,886
your computer may be capable

303
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:46,297
of, when your computer has multiple

304
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,016
calls or lots of

305
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,866
multiple processors, within a processor sometimes

306
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:53,285
there's there's parallelism as well called symdiparallelism [sp].

307
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,242
The computer take care of

308
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:56,727
and you should, there are

309
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,826
very good free libraries

310
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,146
that you can use to do

311
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:02,326
this matrix matrix multiplication very

312
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,104
efficiently so that you

313
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,908
can very efficiently, you

314
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,738
know, makes lots of predictions of lots of hypotheses.
